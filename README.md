# PoE Traffic Light
We modified a pedestrian traffic light with a [StEth32](https://github.com/Techbeard/StEth32) board.  
It is now powered via PoE and controllable with MQTT and Home Assistant.

The code relies heavily on the [MSE-LED-Theke](https://github.com/maker-space-experimenta/MSE-LED-Theke) project.

Pictures of the traffic light can be found in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/_LeoDJ/status/1276531328637435906).
